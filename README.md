# Bezier-Curve
A simple app that uses an intuitive take on writing a bezier curve.
It allows the user to add and remove points and it connects them all smoothly unlike the bezier curve you would get from an equation.
Since this takes an intuitive take it is slower than it should be once you add over 15 points.
